By : Mradul Mourya

A project on Finding profitability for building Apps in particular Genre for both Apple and Google profiles.

I'm not using any libraries in the project for the purpose of improving fundamentals in coding. This Project could certainly made easier with the use of Pandas and Numpy. I'm not using matplotlib as well as there are no graphs just basic analysis based on numbers.
